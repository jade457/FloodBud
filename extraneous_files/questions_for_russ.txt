Why use a QOS value of 0?

correlation between sensor depth and 'actual flooding'

hey, flood levels are decreasing / increasing here

how fast do flood waters flow away?

flood waters will reach your house in 2 hours

given a hundred observations, how do you get the next 100 observation?

Why do all of the sensors only have one observation type?
